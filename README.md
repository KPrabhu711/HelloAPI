# HelloAPI

HelloAPI turns API documentation into two things:
- a quickstart integration pack (README, curl, SDK starter code), and
- an interactive endpoint playground for learning and testing each API call.

## Docs
- Product requirements: `requirements.md`
- System design: `design.md`

## MVP Deliverables
- Generated quickstart pack with auth/setup/first-request guidance
- Python and TypeScript client skeletons with runnable examples
- Interactive endpoint demo UI with parameter forms and response viewer
- Evidence-backed output with TODOs for missing documentation details
